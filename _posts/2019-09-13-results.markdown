Hi, 

after 4 months of coding in our spare time, the project has come to an end and we are proud to present some of the results. 

In the first few weeks, while analyzing the datasets, we realized the complexity of hydrological models from a modelling point of view: 
In contrast to many other tasks like fire risk modelling, we are not dealing with local cause-effect relation but a highly dynamical quantity. 
Water is transported to a certain river point on a wide range of time and spatial scales through quite different mechanisms (surface/sub-surface runoff).
Considering these difficulties, we came up with a 
[complex model architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esowc/ml_flood/master/notebooks/resources/model-steps_v2-1.png) 
that would be able to handle these and predict the river flow on the whole spatial domain.

As the final project deadline came closer, we decided to first finish the more basic model architectures we described in our project proposal
and leave the complex one as conceptual outlook. 

In the end, the results consumed quite a bit more time and effort than expected. 
Nevertheless, some of the most promising machine-learning methods were implemented and tested for the use as 
flood forecasting models: [Linear and Support-vector regression, Gradient-Boosting as well as a time-delay neural network were used.](https://github.com/esowc/ml_flood/tree/master/notebooks/3_model_tests) 

All models were trained with data from ERA5 and GloFAS reanalyses for about ten years and evaluated against each other, but also against persistence forecasts and the GloFAS forecast reruns.
The 2013 European floods served as example case of how these ML models could have predicted the Danube flooding 
the city of Krems. 

Finally, all code is available on [our github page](https://github.com/esowc/ml_flood) for interested people to build their ML models upon.
