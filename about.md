We, Sebastian Lehner and Lukas Kugler, are studying the Master program in Meteorology at the University of Vienna and we expect to finish in 2019.

#### [Sebastian Lehner, BSc](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Lehner)
- Master's thesis: "Detection and attribution of anthropogenic impact on phenological phases"
- Expertise:
  - Meteorology/Climatology
  - Empirical-Statistical downscaling of GCM climate data (with several conference posters)
  - Handling of Big Data in various formats like GRIB or NetCDF (python ...)



#### [Lukas Kugler, BSc](https://lkugler.github.io/)
Master's thesis: "Added value of machine-learning methods in forecasting wind turbine icing"
- Expertise:
  - Numerical Weather Prediction
  - Applied Machine Learning (to predict icing on wind turbines)
  - High Performance Computing and experience in larger-than-RAM applications
  - Handling of Big Data in various formats like GRIB or NetCDF (python ...)


#### Tools
For (big) data analysis and prediction, we use these tools:
Analyzing: pandas, seaborn, xarray, iris, dask
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, keras, pyGAM, pegasosSVM, xgboost
